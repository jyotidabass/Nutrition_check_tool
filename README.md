# Nutrition_check_tool
The purpose of this project is to provide nutrition checking tools that help users have an overview of how much a nutrient in the food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice. All data is sourced from the USDA Food Data Central. My vision and commitment for this project are to provide high-quality data and easy-to-use tools.

This program has 2 steps:

Step 1 is Nutrition Checking Tool For the Nutritional Checking tool: In the first step, the tool will help the user to track what kind of nutrients did they get from the food. Then the program will calculate the amount of all essential nutrients have gained from foods. Especially in this very first version, the program will focus on the nutrition information for the 20 most frequently consumed raw fruits and vegetables in the United States.

Step 2 is Nutrition Searching Engine. For the Nutritional Searching Engine: The user can easily find out the information of Vitamins or Minerals through this step and the program has the suggestion of the raw fruits or vegetables contain that vitamin/mineral. The program also shows us the roles that vitamin/mineral plays in our body.

The purpose of this project is to provide nutrition data tools to help users to get an overview of their daily nutrition and create a better diet. All data is sourced from the USDA Food Data Central. My vision and commitment for this project are to provide high-quality data and easy-to-use tools
